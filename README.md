#  Task Management Application

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to create a web-based task management application using the MERN stack (MySQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to add, update, delete, and view tasks.

## Requirements

### Backend (Node.js and Express.js):

- Set up a Node.js server using Express.js.
- Create RESTful APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- Implement validation for input data (e.g., task title and description).
- Use MySQL as the database to store task information.
- Implement error handling for API requests.

### Frontend (React):

- Create a React application for the frontend.
- Implement a user interface to:
  - Display a list of tasks.
  - Add a new task with a title and description.
  - Update an existing task (title and description).
  - Delete a task.
- Implement form validation for adding and updating tasks.
- Create a user registration, login & profile.
  - Store the data into the database after registration.
  - Create a profile section to display user details with update features.
  - Get user data from the DB, store it into redux, and use it across the application.

### User Authentication:

- Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or any other preferred method.
- Allow users to sign up and log in.
- Ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, and delete tasks.

### Styling:

- Apply CSS or use a CSS framework (Tailwind/React Bootstrap) to style your application and make it user-friendly.

### Deployment:

- Deploy the application to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or any other of your choice.

## Additional Guidelines

- Use best practices for code organization and folder structure.
- Implement proper error handling on both the frontend and backend.
- Use Git for version control and make regular commits with descriptive messages.
- Write clear and concise documentation on how to set up and run the application.

## Submission

- Share your project’s code repository (e.g., GitHub) with the assignment’s reviewer.
- Provide instructions on how to run the application locally.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality:** Does the application perform all the required tasks (CRUD operations on tasks)?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
- **User Interface:** Is the user interface intuitive and responsive?
- **Error Handling:** Does the application handle errors gracefully?
- **Documentation:** Is there clear documentation on how to set up and run the application?

**Note:**
- For databases, MySQL is recommended, not mandatory.
- For frontend, Tailwind is recommended, not mandatory.
